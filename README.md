## 🔍 What is xRAG?

**xRAG** (eXtreme Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a **token-compressed**, **quantized**, and **fully local** RAG system. It’s engineered for **low-latency**, **on-device** question answering and document retrieval—perfect for applications that demand **speed, privacy, and portability**.

---

## 📚 Inspired By 

This project draws from cutting-edge RAG and efficient model deployment research:

- **xRAG (2022)**: 1-token RAG with 17x compression using MLP bridges and I-token projection.


---

## ⚡️ Problem Statement

Most RAG pipelines:
- Are **too bulky** for local use
- Depend on **cloud services**
- Struggle with **low-latency, high-efficiency** deployment

> **xRAG** aims to solve this by going fully local, compressing input, and minimizing memory & compute overhead.
